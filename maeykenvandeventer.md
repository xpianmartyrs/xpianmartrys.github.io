# Maeyken van Deventer

The following is the account of Maeyken van Deventer from *The Bloody Theater or Martyrs Mirror of the Defenseless Christians*, compiled by Thieleman J. van Braght and published in 1660.

MAEYKEN VAN DEVENTER, PUT TO DEATH FOR
THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS CHRIST, AT ROTTERDAM
IN HOLLAND, A. D. 1573.

Not only those of the city of Ghent, in Flanders,
of whom we have just spoken, but also those of
Rotterdam, in Holland, again imbrued their hands
at this time in the blood of the saints. This appeared
in the case of a very pious and godfearing heroine
of Jesus Christ, who, a native of Deventer according
to the flesh, was nevertheless from the heavenly
Jerusalem, born again of God; whose name here
upon earth was Maeyken van Deventer, while her
inward and spiritual name was known only to God,
and recorded in the secret book of God's perpetual
remembrance.

She was apprehended for her saving faith, in the
city of Rotterdam, in Holland, without any fear
from the neighboring cities, as the city of Dortrecht
had already a year before, under the reign
of the Prince of Orange, William I., capitulated,
no longer to shed innocent blood on account of the
faith; which had taken place in July, A. D. 1572,
while this occurred about the middle of the year
1573.

They did not stop at imprisonment, but proceeded
further with her, so that when she could not
be turned from her steadfast and true faith, sentence
of death was speedily pronounced upon her, that
she should be put to death, as an immovable and
obstinate heretic. O God, how couldst thou tolerate
it!

This sentence was speedily executed on her by
the executioner, so that, having commended her
soul into the hands of God, she left her body upon
earth as a prey.


*Observation concerning the death sentence of Maeyken
van Deventer.*

We have taken much trouble, to obtain, if possible,
the death sentence of this pious woman Maeyken
van Deventer, as well as of others of our dear
fellow-believers that were put to death at Rotterdam;
but we have been informed by the secretary
there, who searched for it, that in the year 1600,
just fifty-nine years ago, there was a great fire in
the city hall, whereby the examinations and death
sentences of said martyrs were all burned, together
with all that had been recorded with regard to this,
previous to the year 1600, as we also, for the year
1572, showed to have occurred at Breda; certainly
a lamentable matter, which might cause to pass into
oblivion that which we ought constantly to remember,
namely, the steadfast death of the saints. To
prevent such oblivion, we have deemed it necessary
to notice this matter more fully than has ever before
been done. This by way of notice.


A TESTAMENT MADE BY MAEYKEN VAN DEVENTER
FOR HER CHILDREN.

My children according to the flesh, but, alas!
not according to the spirit, here is a testament,
which I, your mother, leave you, namely, Albert,
Johan, Egbert, Truyken, my dear children. The
Lord bless you, as Isaac blessed his son Jacob,
that he should be a ruler over his brethren. My
children in the flesh, I must leave you young;
may the Most High permit us to meet in the world
to come, which shall Be done before long by the
Father, who will paternally bless us with his most
holy name. This I expect from day to day, that,
when it pleases the Lord, I may offer up my life
and body for his holy name's sake, and I trust that
this will not be deferred, and that the good Lord
will not forget me any longer. When you hear this,
sorrow not, as the world does, which has no hope,
or knows not where they shall be; but thank the
Most High, that you had a mother who was found
worthy to shed her blood for the name of the Lord,
and who, through his great grace and mercy, may
be counted as a witness or martyr. Hence, my children,
respect this testament which I leave you.

I cannot leave you gold or silver, nor can I give
you treasures of this world, as the world gives to
her children; for this I did not take with me, but
left it to your carnal father; and this I also did not
seek, but I sought the eternal riches, which are imperishable.
Do you also seek this way, and you
shall live forever; and follow this testament and the
instruction which I here write you. Even as Christ
Jesus our forerunner left such to us for an everlasting
testament, and sealed it with his blood; such
a testament I also leave you, and will likewise seal
the same with my blood, even as the blessed Jesus
did. My children, do not set at naught or lightly
esteem this; be not heedless: it is better than gold,
for it will save your souls. If you do what I write
you, you shall see me again in great glory, and you
shall be as kings and queens; but you must keep
yourselves from this corruptible world, for it shall
pass away with all its lusts.

Hear, my children, the instruction of your mother,
and incline your hearts to understanding, and open
your ears to hear the words of my mouth, for I seek
the salvation of your souls; believe me, and no one
else, that you may come to me and live forever.
Behold, my children, I hold before you the way of
my Bridegroom, and our forerunner, Christ Jesus,
who went before me, which leads to the truth, as
the Lord has commanded me; and behold, I take
up my cross, and follow the Savior of the whole
world. Do so too, my children; I shall go before
you, without looking back, for this is the way of
the prophets and martyrs, and behold, I shall now
drink the cup which they drank. I now go the way
which Christ Jesus, the Lord full of all grace and
truth, who laid down his life for his sheep, went;
this cup I must drink, as Christ says: I have a cup
to drink of, and a baptism to be baptized with; and
how am I straitened till it be accomplished! Matthew
20;22; Luke 12:50. And having thus passed
through, he calls his sheep, and his sheep hear his
voice, and follow him whithersoever he goeth, for
this is the way to the living fountain; this way went
the priestly kings coming from the rising of the sun,
as is written in Revelation (Rev. 16:12), and entered
into eternity. And behold, they had to drink
of this cup, and to go this way, who are now under
the altar, crying and saying: Lord almighty Father,
how long dost thou not avenge our blood on them
that dwell on the earth? And white robes were given
them, and it was answered unto them: Bear yet for
a little season, till the number of your brethren that
shall also be killed yet for the testimony of Jesus
Christ be fulfilled. Rev. 6:9-11. These also drank
of the cup, and ascended up to enjoy the eternal
Sabbath of the Lord. And of this cup also those
had to drink who are crowned, have palms in their
hands, and are clothed in white. 2 Esd. 2:42. Yea,
this is also the way trod by the four and twenty
elders that stand before the throne of God, and cast
their crowns from their heads, and their harps before
the throne of the Lamb, and falling down upon
their faces, say: O God, to thee alone be praise,
honor and glory, power and strength, forever and
ever. Lord almighty God, who wilt speedily avenge
the blood of thy servants and ministers, thine be
the victory; magnified be thy name, which is, and
which was, and which is to come. Rev. 4:10,11.
This way also walked the marked of the Lord, who
had the mark in their foreheads, who were chosen
out of all the kindreds of men, who were not defiled
with women, but follow the Lamb whithersoever he
goeth. 7:3; 14:3,4. Behold, these had to drink
the bitter cup, and also all those that are still lacking
of the number and fulfillment of Zion, which
is the bride of the Lamb, and the new Jerusalem,
which shall descend out of heaven, in which city
and throne the glory of the great King shall be
revealed and seen, when the marriage feast shall
be kept and celebrated in the day of the high and
holy Sabaoth, the Lord their God, which is the
day of their rest and joy, 6:11; 21:10. Behold,
all these first suffered the judgment in their flesh,
and had to bear the punishment of this world, for
Jesus Christ was the first one, as is written: "The
Lamb slain from the foundation of the world;" and
Paul says, that whom he did foreknow he also did
predestinate to be conformed to the image of his
Son. Rev. 13:8; Rom. 8:29. Christ our Savior
also says, that the servant is not better than his lord,
nor the disciple above his master; but it is enough
for the disciple, that he be as his master. Matthew
10:24,25. This also Peter declares to us, who says
that the time is come that judgment must begin at
the house of God; and if it first begin at God's elect,
what shall the end be of them that have not believed
the Gospel of God? and if the righteous scarcely be
saved, where shall the unrighteous appear? 1 Peter
4:17,18.

Hence, my dear children, press through the strait
gate, for strait and narrow is the way that leadeth
unto life, and few there be that find it, and still less
that walk it; but wide and broad is the way that
leadeth to destruction, and many there be that walk
therein. Matt. 7:13,14.

Therefore, my children, heed the chastening and
instruction of the Lord, and bow your shoulders
under his yoke and easy burden, and bear it patiently
from your youth, thanking him with great
honor, for he receives no sons whom he does not
chasten, for if you forsake chastisement after this
manner, whereof we all are become partakers, you
are not children, but bastards, and you shall be cast
out of your Father's inheritance. Heb. 12:6.

Hence, my dear children, gird your loins, and
follow Christ, and neither fear nor rest till you have
found this way. And search the Scriptures: they
shall show you the way of life, for the angel says
to Esdras: Behold, a city is builded, and set upon
a broad field, and is full of all good things: the
entrance thereof is narrow, and set in a dangerous
place to fall, like as if there were a fire on the right
hand, and on the left a deep water: and one only
path between them both, even between the fire and
the water, so small that there could but one man
go there at once. If this city now were given unto
a man for an inheritance, if he never shall pass the
danger set before it, how shall he receive this inheritance?
2 Esd. 7:6-9. Behold, my children,
this way has no retreats; there are also no by-ways,
that lie on the right hand or on the left; this is the
way which is found by so few, and trod by still
fewer; yea, there are indeed some that see it who
well know that this is the way unto life, but it is
too hard for them; it hurts them far too much.

Therefore, my children, regard not the great
multitude, neither walk in their ways; refrain your
feet from their path, for they go to hell, even as
sheep to the slaughter, as the prophet Isaiah tells
us, saying: "Hell hath opened wide her mouth,
that there may enter in the princes of the earth,
and the common people." For it is a people of no
understanding; therefore he that made them will
not have mercy on them. Prov. 1:15; Isa. 59:7;
5:14; 27:11.

But, my children, remember what I write, and
wherever you hear that there is a plain, rejected
little flock, that is despised and cast out by this
world; join them; and wherever you hear of the
cross of Christ, depart not away. But flee the
shadow of this world, go to God; fear him alone;
keep his commandments; remember all his words
to do after them; write them upon the tables of
your heart, and bind them on your forehead, and
speak of his statutes night and day, and you shall
be a pleasant branch in the garden of the Lord,
yea, a beloved plant growing up in Zion.

My children, call the fear of the Lord your
Father, and wisdom and understanding shall be
your mother. If you do this, my children, the
Lord shall bless you, and sanctify your body for
his service, that his name may be sanctified through
you, and magnified to his glory. Confess him before
men, that he may also confess you before his
heavenly Father. Yea, forsake your life, my children,
rather than that you should depart from the
truth. And follow me; I go before you as a valiant
soldieress, who is prepared for the war or conflict
of the Lord, that I may deliver up my life for the
name of the Lord. My children, I, your mother,
the instrument whereby you have been brought into
this sorrowful world, desire your salvation. Believe
me what I write you and have left you, and no one
else, except what they say agrees with the holy
Scriptures. If you do this, you shall come to me,
and I to you. If you lose your body, which is
of the earth, the Lord has prepared you a better
in heaven. Hence, my children, strive valiantly unto
death for the truth and for righteousness, and arm
yourselves with the armor of God, that you may be
found valiant Israelites; trample down the world
and all unrighteousness that is therein; love or seek
only that which is above, and remember that you
are not of the world, even as your Lord and Master
was also not of the world. John 15:19; 17:16. And
be diligent, that you too may be found disciples;
whatsoever you shall ask then, shall be done unto
you; for no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but
by the Holy Ghost, for the true worshipers shall
worship God in Spirit and in truth; for these Christ
prayed, and not for the world, for when the world
prays, it calls upon the devil, and they desire that
his will be done in them. John 15:7; 1 Cor. 12:3;
John 4:23; 17:9. Hence, my dear children, do
not become conformed to it; flee from it, and have
no fellowship with it. Rom. 12:2; Eph. 5:11. Regard
not what is fair to the eyes, for it is all vanity;
seek only those things which are above, and set
your affection on things above, and not on things
on the earth. Col. 3:1,2. Let your eyes ever look
to the Lord and always labor with prayer and supplication,
that you may ever be with him in heart.
Heb. 12:2. Let your laughter be turned to weeping,
for we are pilgrims here upon earth; and let there
be nothing in this world, which can rejoice you, for
it is all vanity, and passes away. Jas. 4:9; 1 Peter
2:11; 2 Cor. 4:18. Beware of covetousness with
regard to earthly riches, for this is the true foundation
of perdition. Luke 12:15; 1 Tim. 6:9. Remember
me. The Lord cause you to walk in his
fear, and fill you with his Holy Spirit and sanctify
your understanding and mind. My children, be
circumspect in all your conversation, and whatsoever
you do, therein let the name of the Lord be
praised and blessed. Col. 3:17. And guard your
lips, that you may not take the name of God into
your mouth in vain, for this is a great unrecognized
sin; and do not use the name of God, except you
do it with great reverence, with bended knees, and
with uncovered head, or it will be accounted ill to
you. Ex. 20:7. Pray God that you may learn
to know him, and be not ashamed to confess and
honor him, who can save your souls; for the Lord
will not tolerate that his people deny him, for it is
enough that the world dishonors and denies him;
hence let us honor, praise and glorify his holy name
with the whole heart, for it is written, that whosoever
takes the name of the Lord in vain is worthy
of death.

Therefore, my children, love your neighbor heartily,
and this with a liberal heart. Let the light of
the gospel shine in you. 2 Cor. 4:4. Deal your
bread to the hungry, clothe the naked, and do not
suffer anything to remain with you double, since
there are enough that lack. Is. 58:7. And whatsoever
the Lord grants you, that possess with thankfulness,
not only for yourselves, but also for your
neighbor, and seek not your own profit, but that of
your neighbor. In short, my children, let your life
be conformed to the gospel of Christ. And the God
of peace, that brought again from the dead our
Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep,
through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make
you perfect in every good work to do his will,
working in you that which is well pleasing in his
sight, that your whole spirit, soul and body may be
found blameless unto the appearing of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory, power and majesty
forever and ever. Amen. Heb. 13:20,21; 1 Thessalonians
5:23.


A PRAYER BY SAID MAEYKEN VAN DEVENTER.

O holy Father, sanctify the children of thy handmaiden
in thy truth, and keep them from all evil,
and from all unrighteousness, for thy holy name's
sake. O almighty Father, I commend them unto
you, since they are thy creatures; care for them,
for they are thy handiwork; so that they may walk
in thy paths. Amen.
